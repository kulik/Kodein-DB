= Defining the data model

== Models

=== Metadata

IMPORTANT: *Please read xref:immutability.adoc[] first!*

==== ID and Indexes

A model *may* have *one or more* named indexes, to allow you to _search_ and/or _order_ by a specific value.

A model *must* have *one* _unique_ ID, which can be of any type as long as it is <<values, usable as Value>>.
This ID defines the default ordering of the models inside the collections.
In essence, the ID works exactly like an index, except that it is unnamed.
You can use `UUID.randomUUID()` if your model does not have a unique value.

Indexes and IDs can be composite, which means that they can contain multiple values.
A composite index allows you to:

- Get models ordered by first value, then second, then third, then...
- Look for all models with the first value, then second, then third, then...


==== With annotations

When targeting *only the JVM*, you can simply use annotations:

[source,kotlin]
.A simple model
----
data class User(
    @Id val uid: String,
    val firstName: String,
    @Indexed("lastName") val lastName: String
)
----

Using this configuration, when getting all users by index `"lastName"`, they will be ordered first by `lastName`, then by `uid`.
If you want the results to be ordered by `lastName` then `firstName` (then `uid`), you can use a composite index:

[source,kotlin]
.Same model with composite index
----
data class User(
    @Id val uid: String,
    val firstName: String,
    val lastName: String
) {
    @Indexed("name") fun nameIndex() = listOf(lastName, firstName)
}
----


==== With the model

The model itself can define its metadata by implementing either the `Metadata` or `HasMetadata` interface:

[source,kotlin]
.Model *is* metadata
----
data class User(
    override val id: String, //<1>
    val firstName: String,
    val lastName: String
) : Metadata {
    override fun indexes() = mapOf("lastName" to listOf(lastName, firstName)) //<2>
}
----
<1> The `id` property override is mandatory
<2> The `indexes` function override is optional (no index by default)

[source,kotlin]
.Model *has* metadata
----
data class User(
    val id: String,
    val firstName: String,
    val lastName: String
) : HasMetadata {
    override fun getMetadata(db: ModelDB, vararg options: Options.Write) =
            Metadata(id, "lastName" to listOf(lastName, firstName))
}
----


==== With an extractor

If you don't own the models, or if you don't want to mark them for Kodein-DB, you can register a `MetadataExtractor` when you open the database:

[source,kotlin]
.Registering a metadata extractor
----
val db = DB.open("path/to/db",
    MetadataExtractor.forClass<User> {
        Metadata(it.id, "lastName" to listOf(it.lastName, it.firstName))
    }
)
----


[[id-index]]
==== Using ID as an index

If we consider the `User` model we have just defined, we have defined the ID to be a UUID, meaning that the order in which they will be stored and retrieved is completely random. +
Because the ID must be unique, we cannot use the name to be the ID.
However, we can create a composite ID.
Consider this updated model:

[source,kotlin]
.Model with a composite ID
----
data class User(
    val uid: String,
    val firstName: String,
    val lastName: String
) : Metadata {
    override val id get() = listOf(lastName, firstName, uid)
}
----

Because `uid` is unique, the tuple `(lastName, firstName, uid)` is unique (if only because it contains `uid`).
Therefore, the `id` property is always unique, but the order in which the models will be stored are defined first by `lastName`, then by `firstName`, then only by `id`.

CAUTION: While using a composite ID can be very useful, it makes the xref:operations.adoc#key-from-id[creation of key from ID values] more complex.


=== Key & References

If a model contains another model, it will be serialized into the same _document_.
If you need to reference another document, then you need to store either the ID of this other document, or a `Key` (which is the ID of this other document serialized):

[source,kotlin]
.A model with a reference to another model
----
data class User(
    override val id: String,
    val name: Name, //<1>
    val address: Key<Address> //<2>
) : Metadata {
    override fun indexes() = mapOf("lastName" to listOf(name.last, name.first))
}
----
<1> Will be included as part of this model's document.
<2> References another model with its own document.


[[values]]
== IDs and indexes values

While models are stored in the database as serialized blobs, IDs and indexes are stored as `Value`.

NOTE: A `Value` is a serializable entity where the serialized bytes define the ordering of IDs and indexes.

=== Types usable as Value

By default, the Kodein-DB understands the following types to be used as values: `ByteArray`, `ReadBuffer`, `Boolean`, `Short`, `Int`, `Long`, `Char`, `CharSequence` (such as `String`), Kodein-Memory `UUID` (*not* `java.util.UUID`, `Key`).

[IMPORTANT]
====
In order to keep the database efficient and indexes ordering semantic, `Char` and `CharSequence` are stored as UTF-8 characters (i.e. using a variable number of byte per character). You should be careful when using non-ascii characters as their ordering will not always be natural. +
For example, the French language uses the accented letter 'é'. UTF ordering means that "céleri" will be sorted *after* "cuisse". You should therefore unaccent index values.
====

=== Adding new types as value

You can configure Kodein-DB to accept more types as values (and therefore use these types in IDs and indexes).
You simply need to add a `ValueConverter` to the database when creating it:

[source,kotlin]
.a sample ValueConverter for KotlinX LocalDateTime:
----
val db = DB.default.open("path/to/db",
    ValueConverter.forClass<LocalDateTime> {
        Value.of(it.toInstant(TimeZone.UTC).epochSeconds)
    }
)

----

NOTE: A ValueConverter just needs to know how to serialize a type to a `Value`. Values are never deserialized.

=== Multiple index values

`IndexValues` is a special type.
If an index has a value of type `IndexValues`, then each of its containing value will be considered a separate value for this index.
With it, you can define multiple value for the same index.

[TIP]
====
Multiple values are not the same as composite values!
In fact, if an index has multiple value, each of them may be composite.
====

Defining the same value for multiple index has the following effects:

* The model will appear for different search using the same index
* The model may appear multiple times when performing a search that hits multiple values of the same index.

Let's say we define a simple book model:

[source,kotlin]
.A simple book data class:
----
data class Book(
    val name: String,
    val author: String,
    val keywords: List<String>
)
----

Here `keywords` is a list of keyword a user might search for when searching for this book.

Let's make this a model for our database:

[source,kotlin]
.A simple book model:
----
data class Book(
    override val id: UUID,
    val name: String,
    val author: String,
    val keywords: List<String>
) : Metadata {
    override fun indexes() = mapOf(
        "keywords" to IndexValues(keywords)
    )
}
----

Now you can search by index "lastName" with any keyword, and the book will appear in the `Cursor` if it contains the keyword.

WARNING: When using multiple index, the model may appear multiple times when using `find<Type>().byIndex(name)` or `find<Type>().byIndex(name, value, isOpen = true)`. +
In the previous example, a cursor created with `find<Book>().byIndex("keywords")` will return the same book as many times as it has keywords.



[[polymorphism]]
== Polymorphism

=== The problem

By default, Kodein-DB inserts each model in the document collection that corresponds to its real type.

Considering the following insertions:

[source,kotlin]
.Multiple insertions
----
open class Person(@Id val name: String)
class Child(name: String, val parents: List<Key<Person>>): Person(name)

val janeKey = db.put(Person("Jane"))
val johnKey = db.put(Person("John"))

val parents = listOf(janeKey, johnKey)
db.put(Child("Jill", parents))
db.put(Child("Jack", parents))
----

Using the preceding code, there will be two different collections, one `Person`, one `Child`, meaning if you were to look for all `Person` models, you would only get Jane & John.

Children are person too (even when they keep asking you when's the end of this documentation...) so, you probably want to put every `Child` model into the `Person` collection.
To do that, you need to enable polymorphism: the fact that a collection can hold multiple types of models.


=== JVM only annotation

The simpler way to define a polymorphic document is to use the `@Polymorphic` annotation.
However, as usual for annotations, *it only works for the JVM*.

[source,kotlin]
.Children are Persons
----
@Polymorphic(Person::class) //<1>
class Child(name: String, val parents: List<Key<Person>>): Person(name)
----
<1> This `@Polymorphic` annotation instructs Kodein-DB to put `Child` models into the `Person` collection.


[[type-table]]
=== Type Table

In Kodein-DB, the Type Table is responsible for defining which model type belongs to which collection.

NOTE: Using a Type Table is compatible with multiplatform!

You can define a `TypeTable` when opening the database:

[source,kotlin]
.Defining a Type Table
----
val db = DB.open("path/to/db",
    TypeTable {
        root<Person>() //<1>
            .sub<Child>() //<2>
    }
)
----
<1> Defines the root collection `Person`.
<2> Defines that all `Child` models will be put in the `Person` collection.
